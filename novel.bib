  abstract = {Mainstream inventory management approaches typically assume a given theoretical demand distribution and estimate the required parameters from historical data. A time series based framework uses a forecast (and a measure of forecast error) to parameterize the demand model. However, demand might depend on many other factors rather than just time and demand history. Inspired by a retail inventory management application where customer demand, among other factors, highly depends on sales prices, price changes, weather conditions, this paper presents two data-driven frameworks to set safety stock levels when demand depends on several exogenous variables. The first approach uses regression models to forecast demand and illustrates how estimation errors in this framework can be utilized to set required safety stocks. The second approach uses Linear Programming under different objectives and service level constraints to optimize a (linear) target inventory function of the exogenous variables. We illustrate the approaches using a case example and compare two methods with respect to their ability to achieve target service levels and the impact on inventory levels in a numerical study. We show that considerable improvements of the overly simplifying method of moments are possible and that the ordinary least squares approach yields a better performance than the LP-method, especially when the data sample for estimation is small and the objective is to satisfy a non-stockout probability constraint. However, if some of the standard assumptions of ordinary least squares regression are violated, the LP approach provides more robust inventory levels. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {The single-item stochastic lot-sizing problem is to find an inventory replenishment policy in the presence of discrete stochastic demands under periodic review and finite time horizon. A closely related problem is the single-period newsvendor model. It is well known that the newsvendor problem admits a closed formula for the optimal order quantity whenever the revenue and salvage values are linear increasing functions and the procurement (ordering) cost is fixed plus linear. The optimal policy for the single-item lot-sizing model is also well known under similar assumptions. In this paper we show that the classical (single-period) newsvendor model with fixed plus linear ordering cost cannot be approximated to any degree of accuracy when either the demand distribution or the cost functions are given by an oracle. We provide a fully polynomial time approximation scheme for the nonlinear single-item stochastic lot-sizing problem, when demand distribution is given by an oracle, procurement costs are provided as nondecreasing oracles, holding/backlogging/disposal costs are linear, and lead time is positive. Similar results exist for the nonlinear newsvendor problem. These approximation schemes are designed by extending the technique of K-approximation sets and functions.}

This task is non-trivial because the risk of ordering too much or too little is associated with overstocking costs and unsatisfied customers. The well-known newsvendor model captures the essence of this trade-off. Traditionally, this newsvendor problem is solved based on a demand distribution assumption. However, in reality, the true demand distribution is hardly ever known to the decision maker. Instead, large datasets are available that enable the use of empirical distributions. In this paper, we investigate how to exploit this data for making better decisions. We identify three levels on which data can generate value, and we assess their potential. To this end, we present data-driven solution methods based on Machine Learning and Quantile Regression that do not require the assumption of a specific demand distribution. We provide an empirical evaluation of these methods with point-of-sales data for a large German bakery chain. We find that Machine Learning approaches substantially outperform traditional methods if the dataset is large enough. We also find that the benefit of improved forecasting dominates other potential benefits of data-driven solution methods.},

  abstract = {Inaccurate forecasts can be costly for company operations, in terms of stock-outs and lost sales, or over-stocking, while not meeting service level targets. The forecasting literature, often disjoint from the needs of the forecast users, has focused on providing optimal models in terms of likelihood and various accuracy metrics. However, there is evidence that this does not always lead to better inventory performance, as often the translation between forecast errors and inventory results is not linear. In this study, we consider an approach to parametrising forecasting models by directly considering appropriate inventory metrics and the current inventory policy. We propose a way to combine the competing multiple inventory objectives, i.e. meeting demand, while eliminating excessive stock, and use the resulting cost function to identify inventory optimal parameters for forecasting models. We evaluate the proposed parametrisation against established alternatives and demonstrate its performance on real data. Furthermore, we explore the connection between forecast accuracy and inventory performance and discuss the extent to which the former is an appropriate proxy of the latter.},

However, approximating the probability distribution is not easy and is prone to error; therefore, the resulting solution to the newsvendor problem may not be optimal. To address this issue, we propose an algorithm based on deep learning that optimizes the order quantities for all products based on features of the demand data. Our algorithm integrates the forecasting and inventory-optimization steps, rather than solving them separately, as is typically done, and does not view the optimal order quantities as the labels in the deep neural network. However, unlike most deep learning applications, our model does not know the true labels (order quantities), but rather learns them during the training. Numerical experiments on real-world data suggest that our algorithm outperforms other approaches, including data-driven and machine learning approaches, especially for demands with high volatility. Finally, in order to show how this approach can be used for other inventory optimization problems, we provide an extension for (r, Q) policies.},

This simple problem with its intuitively appealing solution is a crucial building block of stochastic inventory theory, which comprises a vast literature focusing on operational efficiency. Typically in this literature, market parameters such as demand and selling price are exogenous. However, incorporating these factors into the model can provide an excellent vehicle for examining how operational problems interact with marketing issues to influence decision making at the firm level. In this paper we examine an extension of the newsvendor problem in which stocking quantity and selling price are set simultaneously. We provide a comprehensive review that synthesizes existing results for the single period problem and develop additional results to enrich the existing knowledge base. We also review and develop insight into a dynamic inventory extension of this problem, and motivate the applicability of such models.}

Rather than a two-step process of first estimating a demand distribution then optimizing for the optimal order quantity, we propose solving the "Big Data" newsvendor problem via single step machine learning algorithms. Specifically, we propose algorithms based on the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) principle, with and without regularization, and an algorithm based on Kernel-weights Optimization (KO). The ERM approaches, equivalent to high-dimensional quantile regression, can be solved by convex optimization problems and the KO approach by a sorting algorithm. We analytically justify the use of features by showing that their omission yields inconsistent decisions. We then derive finite-sample performance bounds on the out-of-sample costs of the feature-based algorithms, which quantify the effects of dimensionality and cost parameters. Our bounds, based on algorithmic stability theory, generalize known analyses for the newsvendor problem without feature information. Finally, we apply the feature-based algorithms for nurse staffing in a hospital emergency room using a data set from a large UK teaching hospital and find that (i) the best ERM and KO algorithms beat the best practice benchmark by 23{\%} and 24{\%} respectively in the out-of-sample cost, and (ii) the best KO algorithm is faster than the best ERM algorithm by three orders of magnitude and the best practice benchmark by two orders of magnitude.},

We focus on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and revisit the visualization of CNN representations, methods of diagnosing representations of pre-trained CNNs, approaches for disentangling pre-trained CNN representations, learning of CNNs with disentangled representations, and middle-to-end learning based on model interpretability.

First, the demand is modeled as a time series which follows an autoregressive process AR(p), p≥1. Second, a robust approach to maximize the worst-case revenue is proposed: a robust distribution-free autoregressive method for the newsvendor problem, which copes with non-stationary time series, is formulated. A closed-form expression for the optimal solution is found for p=1; for the remaining values of p, the problem is expressed as a nonlinear convex optimization program, to be solved numerically. The optimal solution under the robust method is compared with those obtained under three versions of the classic approach, in which either the demand distribution is unknown, and autocorrelation is neglected, or it is assumed to follow an AR(p) process with normal error terms. Numerical experiments show that our proposal usually outperforms the previous benchmarks, not only with regard to robustness, but also in terms of the average revenue. Extensions to multiperiod and multiproduct models are also discussed.},

The model allows partial backlogging and permits part of the backlogged shortages to turn into lost sales.

  abstract = {This paper focuses on one-shot (one-time) decision problems, which concern the situations where a decision is experienced only once. Such one-shot decision problems are commonly encountered in business, economics, and social systems. The one-shot decision process comprises two steps. In the first step, a decision maker identifies which state of nature should be taken into account for each alternative among all available states of nature. These identified states of nature are called focus points. Twelve types of focus points are proposed according to a decision maker's attitudes about the possibility of a state of nature and satisfaction resulted by its occurrence. In the second step, a decision maker evaluates the alternatives based on focus points where the consequences provided by all alternatives are compared with each other to obtain the best alternative. The relationships between different focus points are analyzed. An example, which is a newsvendor problem of a new product with a short life cycle, is used to illustrate the one-shot decision. The results of analysis show that the proposed decision models can provide useful insights into understanding different behaviors of decision makers and help the decision maker in finding out the best solution according to his/her attitude about possibility and satisfaction.},

  abstract = {In this paper, newsvendor problems for innovative products are analyzed. Because the product is new, no relevant historical data is available for statistical demand analysis. Instead of using the probability distribution, the possibility distribution is utilized to characterize the uncertainty of the demand. We consider products whose life cycles are expected to be smaller than the procurement lead times. Determining optimal order quantities of such products is a typical one-shot decision problem for a retailer. Therefore, newsvendor models for innovative products are proposed based on the one-shot decision theory (OSDT). The main contributions of this research are as follows: the general solutions of active, passive, apprehensive and daring focus points and optimal alternatives are proposed and the existence theorem is established in the one-shot decision theory; a simple and effective approach for identifying the possibility distribution is developed; newsvendor models with four types of focus points are built; managerial insights into the behaviors of different types of retailers are gained by the theoretical analysis; the proposed models are scenario-based decision models which provide a fundamental alternative to analyze newsvendor problems for innovative products.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we consider a manufacturer who produces and sells a kind of innovative product in the monopoly market environment. Because the life cycle of an innovative product is usually shorter than its procurement lead time, one unique demand quantity (scenario) will occur in the selling season; thus, there is only one chance for the manufacturer to determine both optimal production quantity and optimal sale price. Considering this one-time feature of such a decision problem, a price-setting newsvendor model for innovative products is proposed. Different to the existing price-setting newsvendor models, the proposed models determine the optimal production quantity and sale price based on some specific state (scenario) which is most applicable for the manufacturer. The theoretical analysis provides managerial insights into the manufacturers' behaviors in a monopoly market of an innovative product, and several phenomena in the luxury goods market are well explained.},

 abstract = {A simple minimization problem yielding the ordinary sample quantiles in the location model is shown to generalize naturally to the linear model generating a new class of statistics we term "regression quantiles." The estimator which minimizes the sum of absolute residuals is an important special case. Some equivariance properties and the joint asymptotic distribution of regression quantiles are established. These results permit a natural generalization of the linear model of certain well-known robust estimators of location. Estimators are suggested, which have comparable efficiency to least squares for Gaussian linear models while substantially out-performing the least-squares estimator over a wide class of non-Gaussian error distributions.},
